# VFAPP

## Video Filter App

A versatile video filtering application built with Python and Tkinter, designed to help users filter video files based on various criteria such as codec, resolution, duration, file size, bitrate, framerate, display aspect ratio, color space, and bit depth. This tool is perfect for quickly narrowing down video files in a directory according to specific needs.

### [1.2.0] - 28/11/2024

#### Added

**Framerate Filtering:**

- Added input fields to specify minimum and maximum framerate (in fps).
- Enhanced the filtering logic to include these new options.
- Framerate information is displayed in the results table.

**Display Aspect Ratio Filtering:**

- Added input field for specifying display aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9).
- Aspect ratio is automatically calculated if not explicitly provided by the video metadata.

**Color Space Filtering:**

- Added a dropdown list to filter videos by color space. Supported color spaces include:
  - sRGB, Adobe RGB, ProPhoto RGB, Rec. 709, Rec. 2020, DCI-P3, Apple RGB, CMYK, YUV, and more.
- Color space information is displayed in the results table.

**Bit Depth Filtering:**

- Added input fields to specify minimum and maximum bit depth.
- Bit depth is inferred from video pixel format if not explicitly provided in metadata.
- Bit depth information is displayed in the results table.

**Enhanced Results Table:**

- New columns added for:
  - Framerate
  - Display Aspect Ratio (DAR)
  - Color Space
  - Bit Depth
- Existing columns such as Name, Size, Codec, Bitrate, and Bitrate Mode remain sortable.

#### Improvements

- Default window size set to 700x860 for better usability.
- Aligned input fields in the GUI to improve readability and symmetry.
- Enhanced progress bar and status messages to better reflect the current processing state.
- Added tooltips for all new filters and table columns, providing clearer descriptions.

- Aspect ratio is calculated dynamically when not explicitly provided, ensuring accurate filtering and display.

#### Export Enhancements

- CSV export now includes all newly added parameters (Framerate, DAR, Color Space, and Bit Depth).
- Error handling improved to ensure smooth export even when certain metadata is missing.
